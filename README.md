# Kickstarting with Excel
Through Excel, all data is collected in the Kickstarter sheet.
## Overview of Project
The theater category is close to its fundaraising goal in a short period of time. We analysis how different activities perform in terms of release dates and funding goal, and visualize the results of the activities based on the launch data and funding goals.
### Purpose
