# Kickstarting with Excel
Through Excel, all data is collected in the Kickstarter sheet.
## Overview of Project
The theater category is close to its fundaraising goal in a short period of time. We analysis how different activities perform in terms of release dates and funding goal, and visualize the results of the activities based on the launch data and funding goals.
### Purpose
Through this analysis, we have a detailed understanding of the number of successes, failures and cancellations of the theater in each month. Not only that, we also analyzed the target amount for play.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
For the chart of Outcomes Base on Launch Date, no difficulties occurred. For the chart of Based on Goal, the more difficult part is to determine the accurate analysis of the contents of each Countifs function. Fortunately, this chart can be completed by carefully checking the contents of each function as long as it takes more time.
## Results
1. From the chart of the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date, we can see that the success rate is higher in May and June. However, the number of failed campaigns launched in May, June, July, August and October was roughly the same.
2. From the chart, we can find that the percentage Failed is higher in 20000 to 24999, 25000 to 29999, 30000 to 34999, 45000 to 499999, and greater than 50000. In addition, the percentage canceled is always zero
3. This data set is presented as a percentage, and there is no way to know the true amount. In fact, there are many materials with a small total, which will lead to inaccurate judgments when making decisions.
4. We can create a new chart, use number to replace persentage, and use two charts to compare, we can understand the current situation and make the best strategy.
